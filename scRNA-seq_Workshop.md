# Cell Dissociation Methods
Th best way to achieve a good, clean scRNA-seq data set is to optimize your dissociation protocol for the tissues from which you are hoping to isolate cells. It is dually important to take into consideration the cell types you are hoping to isolate. For example, a hardier cell type in a tougher tissue may tolerate a harsh enzymatic digestion and result in a higher cell yield. There are many dissociation protocols available online at the 10X Genomics website linked [here](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/single-cell-gene-expression/documentation/steps/sample-prep). Today we will be discussing basic mechanical and enzymatic digestion. We will also review several types of reagents commonly used in enzymatic digestion.

- Mechanical Digestion: Mechanical digestion is the process of physically mincing, chopping, or pulverizing tissue to release cells from their organs or matrices.
- Enzymatic Digestion: Enzymatic digestion the process of freeing cells from their tissues using enzymes. Frequently, a combination of mechanical and enzymatic digestion is utilized to attain a single cell suspension. Below we have characterized a few reagents typically used for enzymatic digestion:
  - DNAse: DNAse I is used in tissue dissociation to degrade free DNA that exist in our suspension after dead cells are lysed. These pieces of DNA are often "sticky" and cause cells to clump together so getting rid of them is advantageous.
  - Collagenase: This class of enzymes specifically breaks down peptide bonds in collagen. A range of collagenases are commercially available and optimized for different tissues or cell types. It is important to consult the manufacturer's information to select the best collagenase for your dissociation.
  - Liberase: Liberase is a blend of enzymes that were designed to improve viability and functionality of isolated cells.
  - Dispase: Dispase cleaves fibronectin and collagen IV.
  - Accutase: This is a solution of proteolytic and collagenolytic enzymes that are useful for detatchment of cells from culture dishes and one another to a lesser extent.

** Note - Cells do not like being outside of a tissue environment or in enzymatic cocktails. Optimizing your dissociation method to reduce the time cells spend in solutions is beneficial. Take into careful consideration the type of tissue you are working with as well as the type of cells you wish to isolate.

- Filtering: After successfully dissociating your tissues it is vital to filter your suspension. This remove clumps of cells and large debris that can impede downstream library preparation.

# Library Preparation Methods
 - Combinatorial Barcoding - Individual cells are placed in their own barcoded wells. These barcodes are appended to the transcripts in the wells. This process is repeated two more times before the cells are pooled into 8 libraries. These cells are then lysed and receive an Illumina barcode. Transcripts that contain the same four barcode combination are from the same cell. See the below schematic to better understand his process. One example of this type of library preparation is Parse Bioscience. Here is a link to a video detailing this [process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVx4UBweNH4) and a link to the Parse Biosciences [website](https://www.parsebiosciences.com/).
